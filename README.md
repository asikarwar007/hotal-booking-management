A simple, easy to use and flexible online booking system for hotels, residences, apartments etc... It is written in PHP and uses MySQL, and works with any operating system.

You can view and test the current development version here. At the moment are implemented only few features (the ones you see in the demo pages and regarding admin section) and are online only for testing, so fell free testing it and tell us what do you think about it.

When some other feature will be implemented, this page will be substituted by a prettier web site and project's files (alpha version) will be available for download.
